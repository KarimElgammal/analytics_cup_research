    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In Europe, there are many excellent calibre players who could change the course of the game. One of them is Julián Alvarez who represents a modern forward archetype characterised by intelligent movement, spatial awareness, and clinical finishing. This research asks whether SkillCorner tracking data can identify A-League players with similar characteristics, primarly for Julián Alvarez then extended to other profiles with players who had good representation in online free datasets such as StatsBomb.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I focused on Julián Alvarez case, while in the related streamlit app, I have implemented richer interface with scouting profiles for other attackers, defenders and goalkeepers ([run using run.sh](run.sh)), ofcourse you can change here in the code to other profiles as well. Using data from 10 A-League matches, I construct player profiles based on final third entry patterns and compute similarity scores against archetypes programmatically derived from StatsBomb event data. The system supports 12 player archetypes across forwards, defenders, and goalkeepers; all computed from World Cup 2022 statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to demonstrate how to scout potential players from data-driven archetypes by augmenting different data sources."

    "## 2. Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 The Alvarez Archetype\n",
    "\n",
    "The Alvarez archetype is computed from StatsBomb free event data using the `src/statsbomb/` package. From World Cup 2022 matches, the system extracts key statistics:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Metric | Actual Value | Interpretation |\n",
    "|--------|--------------|----------------|\n",
    "| Shots | 11 | Active in final third |\n",
    "| Goals | 4 | Clinical finisher |\n",
    "| Conversion Rate | 36.4% | Elite finishing (95th percentile) |\n",
    "| Shot Accuracy | 72.7% | Highly accurate |\n",
    "| Dribble Success | 0.0% | Creates through movement, not dribbling |\n",
    "\n",
    "The low dribble success is critical: Alvarez creates danger through intelligent movement and positioning, not individual dribbling. This maps to a low `carry_pct` target in the similarity scoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from src.core.archetype import Archetype\n",
    "archetype = Archetype.from_statsbomb(\"alvarez\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The system supports 12 other archetypes across forwards, defenders, and goalkeepers. Run `streamlit run app.py` for interactive comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 ML-Calibrated Feature Weights\n",
    "\n",
    "I trained GradientBoosting classifiers for each position to empirically determine feature importance:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Position | Target Variable | AUC | Events |\n",
    "|----------|-----------------|-----|--------|\n",
    "| Forwards | lead_to_shot | 0.656 | 245 entries |\n",
    "| Defenders | stop_possession_danger | 0.845 | 8,911 engagements |\n",
    "| Goalkeepers | pass_success | 0.993 | 497 distributions |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Forward weights** (from entry danger prediction):\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | ML Importance | Final Weight |\n",
    "|---------|---------------|--------------|\n",
    "| avg_separation | 16.2% | 23% |\n",
    "| danger_rate | (target) | 18% |\n",
    "| avg_entry_speed | 11.8% | 17% |\n",
    "| avg_defensive_line_dist | 10.3% | 15% |\n",
    "| central_pct | 8.5% | 12% |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Defender weights** (from stop danger prediction): engagement distance (17%), pressing rate (4%), goal-side positioning (3%), with outcome metrics (stop/reduce danger, beaten rates) weighted by importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goalkeeper weights** (from pass success prediction): pass distance dominates (98.6% ML importance), balanced with style differentiators (long/short pass preference) for archetype comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Similarity Scoring\n",
    "\n",
    "I compute weighted cosine similarity on z-score normalised features. The target profile uses percentile-mapped values from StatsBomb statistics. For attackers, players with fewer than three entries are excluded to ensure profile reliability.\n",
    "\n",

    "### 3.2. Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "The radar chart reveals interesting patterns when comparing A-League candidates against the Alvarez target profile (shown as the dashed orange line). The target profile emphasises high separation, danger rate, and central positioning while deliberately setting a low carry percentage, reflecting that Alvarez creates through movement rather than dribbling.\n",
    "\n",
    "**T. Imai** from Western United emerges as the top match with exceptional separation (5.64m) and a 40% danger rate. His high separation value indicates he consistently finds space away from defenders, a key characteristic of the Alvarez archetype. The combination of space creation and shot generation mirrors Alvarez's intelligent movement patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**N. Atkinson** from Melbourne City follows with balanced metrics: 16.7% danger rate, 16.7% central entry percentage, and 4.41m separation. His profile suggests a player comfortable operating in central areas while maintaining good spacing from defenders.\n",
    "\n",
    "**K. Bos** from Melbourne Victory presents similar characteristics with 4.14m separation and 16.7% danger rate. His profile indicates consistent space-finding ability, though with entries predominantly from wide areas (0% central).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Z. Clough** from Adelaide United, ranked fourth, shows the highest danger rate in the top five at 50% and the highest central percentage at 25%. His separation value (3.41m) suggests he operates slightly closer to defenders but compensates with clinical output when receiving the ball.\n",
    "\n",
    "The current rankings heavily weight separation (avg_separation at 23%), which identifies players who find space between defensive lines. This aligns with Alvarez's playing style of intelligent off-ball movement rather than relying on pace or dribbling to beat defenders.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "Several limitations should be acknowledged:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sample size: 10 matches constrains reliability, with some players having as few as three entries\n",
    "2. Cross-dataset mapping: StatsBomb events → SkillCorner tracking requires conceptual translation\n",
    "3. Context differences: A-League tactical context differs from World Cup matches where archetypes are derived\n",
    "4. Entry method homogeneity: 97.6% of entries are classified as carries, leaving insufficient variation to distinguish players by entry style\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these constraints, the methodology demonstrates that broadcast tracking data can identify players matching specific stylistic archetypes. This has practical applications for recruitment, where clubs might seek players fitting particular tactical profiles."

    "## 4. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This research demonstrates a methodology for player similarity analysis using SkillCorner broadcast tracking data. By computing archetypes programmatically from StatsBomb event data and applying ML-calibrated similarity weights across all positions, I identified A-League players who exhibit similar characteristics to world-class archetypes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Contributions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Archetype generation: 12 player archetypes computed from StatsBomb World Cup 2022 data\n",
    "2. ML-calibrated weights for all positions: GradientBoosting models trained per position type:\n",
    "   - Forwards: AUC 0.656 (predict shot creation)\n",
    "   - Defenders: AUC 0.845 (predict stopping danger)\n",
    "   - Goalkeepers: AUC 0.993 (predict distribution success)\n",
    "3. Cross-domain mapping: StatsBomb events → SkillCorner tracking target profiles\n",
    "4. Extensible framework: Easy to add new archetypes or apply to other SkillCorner datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interactive Tool\n",

    "Supports 12 archetypes: 6 forwards (Alvarez, Giroud, Kane, Lewandowski, Rashford, En-Nesyri), 3 defenders (Gvardiol, Romero, Hakimi), 3 goalkeepers (Lloris, Livakovic, Bounou).\n",
    "\n",
    "For scouts and analysts, this provides a data-driven starting point for identifying players who might fit specific tactical roles."
